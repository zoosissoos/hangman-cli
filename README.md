# hangman-cli


This is a game that was made for a homework assignment at a coding bootcamp.

We were instructed to make a node.js CLI hangman game using constructors and module exports.

This game was made possible with guidence of Adam Kwan.

Heads up, the words in here are beer/liqour themed. Enjoy responsibly with a nice beverage.
